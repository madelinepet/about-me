# about-me
About me project for week 1 of Code Fellows 201.

## Purpose
As a student at Code Fellows, I would like to design an About Me project that builds on my previous knowledge while implimenting new knowledge so I can grow into a strong developer and see my progress over time when I look back. I would also like this to build a framework for future Avout Me projects that I develop when I have learned even more.

## Design
This project asks questions about me and provides feedback to the user when they answer questions correctly or incorrectly.

## Built with: 
VS Code
