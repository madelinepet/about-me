# about-me
About me project for week 1 of Code Fellows 201.

## Purpose
As a student at Code Fellows, I would like to design an About Me project that builds on my previous knowledge while implimenting new knowledge so I can grow into a strong developer and see my progress over time when I look back. I would also like this to build a framework for future Avout Me projects that I develop when I have learned even more.

## Design
This project asks questions about me and provides feedback to the user when they answer questions correctly or incorrectly. It keep track of the user's correct and incorrect answers and displays a score at the end.

## Built with: 
VS Code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
